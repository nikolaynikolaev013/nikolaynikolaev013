# 👋 Hi, I'm Nikolay Nikolaev

I'm a **Full-Stack .NET Developer** with over 3 years of experience building scalable, production-grade applications using **ASP.NET Core**, **React**, **Azure**, and **SQL**. I enjoy solving technical challenges, writing clean code, and mentoring junior developers. I’ve worked on both enterprise-grade systems and real-world client projects (some under NDA).

Currently, I’m enrolled in **SoftUni’s AI Program**, expanding my skills into machine learning and intelligent systems.
